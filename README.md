# Sudoku Solver

It is an intro for me to ```The Wavefunction Collapse Algorith``` which is a procedural generation algorithm that uses principles from quantum mechanics and constraint satisfaction to create structures and patterns. 

Here I implemented automatic Sudoku Solver, which uses simmilar patterns. it was just the practice, next goal is to implement some generator.

Also here I might implement some picture analysis and get data from the picture, not from the keyboard :P.
